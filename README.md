## EtherChannel
    - Configuring Layer 2/Layer 3 EtherChannels
        - ASW1 - Access layer switch
        - DSW1 - Distributed layer switch
> When the bandwidth of the interfaces connected to the end hosts is greater than the bandwidth of the connection to the distribution switch(es), this is called **over-subscription**. Some over-subscription is acceptable, but to much will cause congestion.
